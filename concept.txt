Equipment for equipment grids
- increase radar range of the owner
- consume power
- only active when powered

Other stuff
- item
- recipe
- technology

The range can be extended using one of the following

Radars
- invisible
- teleported using control scripting

Spidertrons
- invisible
- positioned using following offsets
- basically infinite speed

TODO: test how follow offsets for spidertrons even work
they don't perfectly move to the follow_offset,
but it seems to work within like 8 tiles of inaccuracy

spidertrons with follow offsets, or spidertorns in genral, are way too inaccurate.
they accelerate towards the traget, and once they've reached it they slow down again,
or something around those lines
anyway, with too much speed they tend to overshoot their target, causing them to reverse,
but miss again so it's a long period of bouncing back and forth.
and since the player can teleport, or move really quickly because of trains, and trains
can also have equipment, this simply won't work.
